### `npm start`
hit frontend directory from terminal: cd frontend 
then npm Install
hit Backend directory from terminal: cd backend 
then npm install

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [ http://localhost:5173/]( http://localhost:5173/) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
