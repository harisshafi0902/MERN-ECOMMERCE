then npm Install

hit Backend directory from terminal: cd backend 

then npm install

After installing packages both for frontend and backend, run the following commands:

npm run dev 

for both frontend and backend.

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [ http://localhost:5173/]( http://localhost:5173/) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
